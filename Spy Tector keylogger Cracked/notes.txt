Spytector 1.3.1 - the ultimate undetectable spy tool used to track all PC activities.

The trial version of Spytector is detected by few antivirus applications, even if
it's not a trojan or a hacking tool. Spytector is a commercial legitimate keylogger
and our customers must be able to use Spytector on their computers in the same time
with other security applications, so the version they receive (the full version)
will be undetected for all the well known antivirus products.

Spytector is tracking all the activities of PC users (visited websites, all the
keystrokes, opened windows, applications etc.) and delivers the logs to you via
Email or/and FTP. In the delivered logs are also included the Protected Storage
passwords (Outlook, MSN and others), FireFox passwords and URL history (visited
websites). The keylogger is using advanced hooking and stealth techniques.

Spytector is completely invisible on the user desktop and cannot be seen in the
task manager, it's injected into explorer.exe on the startup and whenever the log
must be sent it will inject in the default browser or/and in the default emailer
(for firewall bypass necessity). 

Spytector server size is pretty small (about 30 KB). It doesn't need much resources,
the memory requirements are low enough to run even on slow computers. 

Spytector server is compatible with Windows 98, ME, NT4, 2000, XP and 2003.
In the case of Windows NT (2000, XP, 2003) it works even on the Guest account.
